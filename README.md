 - This project uses Markov-Chain to generate a lyrics, poem and sentence using a style text of an artist.  
 - Markov-Chain doesn't have memory, so the final result isn't as intelligent; some senetence make sence some dosen't. However this approach can provide a sentence with an artist style. For more intelligent text generation use deep learning LSTM(Long Short Term Memeory) or refere to my repo [next-word-prediction](https://github.com/meuzgebre/nlp/next-word-eng).
